Using Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms for semantic search within a cache layer is appropriate and increasingly common, particularly in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI applications. This approach is known as semantic caching.
How it works:
Embedding Generation: When a query arrives, it is first converted into a numerical representation called an embedding, capturing its semantic meaning.
ANN Search: Instead of searching for an exact match of the query in the cache (like traditional caching), an ANN algorithm is used to search for semantically similar embeddings within the cached entries.
Cache Hit/Miss:
Cache Hit: If a sufficiently similar embedding is found above a predefined similarity threshold, the corresponding cached response is returned, reducing the need to re-process the query or call external APIs.
Cache Miss: If no sufficiently similar embedding is found, the query proceeds to be processed (e.g., sent to an LLM), and the new query and its response are then added to the cache for future use.
Benefits of Semantic Caching with ANN:
Reduced Latency: By serving semantically similar queries from the cache, response times are significantly improved, especially for LLM-based applications that can be computationally intensive.
Cost Savings: Fewer calls to external APIs or LLMs result in lower operational costs.
Improved Efficiency: Reduces redundant processing for queries with similar intent but different phrasing.
Enhanced User Experience: Faster responses lead to a more fluid and responsive user interaction.
Considerations:
Embedding Model Choice: The quality of the semantic cache heavily relies on the effectiveness of the embedding model used.
Similarity Threshold: Carefully setting the similarity threshold is crucial to balance cache hit rates and the relevance of cached responses.
Cache Management: Strategies for eviction, freshness, and handling varying item lifetimes are still necessary, similar to traditional caching.
Computational Overhead: Generating embeddings and performing ANN searches introduces some local computational overhead, though this is typically outweighed by the benefits of avoiding remote calls or LLM processing.
