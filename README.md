# IntelligentResponseCache
Agentic Multi-Tier Response Cache using AWS Bedrock, LangGraph, Redis and PostgreSQL

Goals and scope
• 	Primary outcomes: Improve latency and reduce LLM cost by avoiding redundant generations, without harming accuracy or freshness.
• 	Agentic requirement: An orchestrator that decides when to serve cache, when to regenerate, and when to background-refresh, using intent, similarity, and freshness signals.

# Reference architecture
## API layer
- API Gateway: AuthN/AuthZ, rate limits, request coalescing.
- Agent Router
- Intent Classifier: Routes to task type (Q&A, summarization, code, tool-use).
- Cache Orchestrator: Exact → parametric → semantic cascade; freshness checks; confidence gating.
## Caches (tiered)
- (Optional) L1 in-process cache: Ultra-low latency, small TTLs for hot keys; per-pod memory.
- L2 distributed KV: ElastiCache/Redis for exact/parametric hits; eviction policy.
- Semantic Cache: Vector index for paraphrase/near-duplicate queries; thresholded similarity.
- Tool/Function Cache: Deterministic caching of tool results (e.g., SQL, HTTP calls) with ETags.
## Knowledge + RAG
- Document Store: Versioned chunks with ETags; embedding pipeline; invalidation hooks.
- Retriever: Chunk-level cache keyed by query and corpus version.
## Safety & Compliance
- PII/PHI Filter: Redacts or blocks cache writes; labels sensitivity.
- Policy Engine: Tenant/region data boundaries; encryption; retention.
## Observability
- Telemetry: Hit ratio, cost avoided, tail latency, freshness misses, semantic distances, safety blocks.
- Feedback Loop: User ratings, auto-regeneration on low-quality signals.

Deployment note: Run on Kubernetes/EKS with sidecars for mTLS, Prometheus for metrics, and autoscaling on QPS + miss ratio. Use KMS for secrets, IAM roles for service accounts, and network segregation by tenant when required.
